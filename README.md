The goal of this project is to generate map images from satellite images using a GAN-based approach. The model consists of two neural networks: a generator that creates fake map images from satellite inputs, and a discriminator that attempts to differentiate real maps from generated ones. The generator aims to fool the discriminator, improving its performance over time. An input and corresponding output images are in the repository for better understanding of model working.
